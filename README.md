Analysis
Based on the scatter plot it might be possible to analyze some cryptocurrencies could be clustered together if there was better analysis done on the algorithms and they could somehow be generalized in some way similar to Proof Type. If there was a way to introduce some generality there the clusters may look better.

The Elbow curve is a different story. It's basically a straigth line. It's so straight, my first impression is that I did something wrong, but I checked our lessons on this and it appears correct ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I would consider a subset of these coins to cluster, like taking all Proof of Work or Proof of Stake together and see if the algorithms aligned a bit better. The high degree of variability in the features based on Proof Type and Algorithm make it difficult
